In reservoir computing, the dimension of the state–space of the reservoir is typically much larger than the input space while forecasting dynamical systems, and the map f in (2) is supposed to have much lesser functional complexity than the map that generates the data.

A nonautonomous dynamical system is simply a dynamical system (as defined before in \ref{Dfn_DS}) where the input $u$ from the input space $U$, a  topological space, is time-dependent. \ednote{This means it can no longer be generated by a flow?}
(recall from \ref{attractor_U}) into the higher dimensional space $X\times{X}$.\ednote{(B: Why is it true that it's higher-dimensional?)}

% \begin{eqnarray}
% \theta_{1}^{''} = \frac{-g(2m_1+m_2)\sin{\theta_1} - m_{2}g\sin(\theta_1 - 2\theta_2) -2\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)m_2({\theta_{2}'}^{2}L_2 + \theta_{1}^{2}L_{1}\cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2))}{L_1(2m_1+m_2-m_2\cos({2\theta_1 -2\theta_2}))} \\
% \theta_{2}^{''} = \frac{ 2\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)(\theta_{1}'^2 L_1 (m_1+m_2) + g(m_1+m_2)\cos{\theta_1} + \theta_{2}'^2 L_2 m_2 \cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2))}{L_2(2m_1+m_2-m_2\cos({2\theta_1 -2\theta_2}))}

Another limitation owes itself to the requirement that T be a surjective map. This is not always the case in practical examples and we may consider the case of a damped double pendulum \ednote{M: Please remove the paragraph as well. We do not overcome this problem. You can add this in the next Chapter where you need T to be surjective or else you could include this at the begining of this chapter where you explain the forecasting problem.}
