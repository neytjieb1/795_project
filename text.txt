Inleiding

"echo state"
"embedded attractor" used out of the blue

Section 2
ons begin eweskielik van "chaos" praat, maar sonder enige vooraf rede


Section 3
Give T as surjective

Another limitation owes itself to the requirement that T be a surjective map. This is not always the case in practical examples and we may consider the case of a damped double pendulum \ednote{M: Please remove the paragraph as well. We do not overcome this problem. You can add this in the next Chapter where you need T to be surjective or else you could include this at the begining of this chapter where you explain the forecasting problem.}

Section 4
A nonautonomous dynamical system is simply a dynamical system (as defined before in \ref{Dfn_DS}) where the input $u$ from the input space $U$, a  topological space, is time-dependent. \ednote{This means it can no longer be generated by a flow?}
(recall from \ref{attractor_U}) into the higher dimensional space $X\times{X}$.\ednote{(B: Why is it true that it's higher-dimensional?)}
